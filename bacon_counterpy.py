#Create a class called Bacon_count, which inherits, or takes properties, from the MRJob class. We create this class to be called to run the full MapReduce job withMRJob:

class Bacon_count(MRJob):

#Next, create a mapper()function that will take (self, _, line) as parameters. The mapper() function will assign the input to key-value pairs:
def mapper(self, _, line):
#The second parameter (here using an underscore (_), explained next) allows methods to be mapped together. 
#Since we are not chaining anything together, we use the Python convention of an underscore to indicate that we wonâ€™t use this parameter. The line parameter will be the line of text taken from the raw input file.
